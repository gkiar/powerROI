The pictures show consensus images of the 264 and “modified voxelwise” communities.

If you want to use the 264 ROIs, assignments at all thresholds for both groups are in the .xlsx, as are consensus assignments. Also provided are .foci and .focicolor files in the Caret format. Pictures are present.

If you want to use the modified voxelwise communities, assignments at all thresholds for both groups are in .nii files. Consensus .nii and .4dfp files are also provided, as are the Caret files (.paint and .areacolor) for consensus assignments, and a colored picture of the assignments in slices and on surfaces.

All analyses were done in 3mm isotropic voxels in the “KY” atlas at Washington University, using the 4dfp format. The MNI is a linear transform into MNI152 space, as are the coordinates in the .xlsx. For the 2 .nii files with modified voxelwise assignments over thresholds, group 2 is 5.5-0.5% in 0.5% steps, group 1 is 5-1% in 1% steps.

I don’t have a .nii of the 264 ROIs to distribute: your coordinates may differ, as may your resolution/sphere size. I tell people to create spherical ROIs at the coordinates, once transformed into your space to your satisfaction.
